If you want to find new artists, you'll have to sift through playlist on top of playlist for hours. You can listen to music together with your friends on Spotify, but it only limited to 8 people, and only people who sent you an invitation. Musaik will connect users through streaming parties and auto-match chats. Users will discover new music easily and enjoyably.\n          </div> \n          </div>  \n\n          <div class=\"iitem4\">\n           <div className=\"sectionName\"> \n           Project Scope\n           </div>\n          <div className=\"description3\"> \n            Originally as a project for the Agile Software Development class, we as a team were supposed to quickly create an app from scratch in the agile style, and we only had 2 days to come up with the UX/UI prototype. <br/>\n            Now, after this class has ended, I challenged myself in creating a more user-friendly and intuitive design for Musaik so it can help more people to discover new music and connect through it.  <br/>\n            Based on the existing MVP I created a high-fidelity prototype with many iterations including user testing. This project was highly focused on UI design and exploring multiple solutions for launching this app\n          </div>\n          </div>\n\n        <div class=\"iitem5\">\n        <div className=\"sectionName\"> \n           Design Process\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"description4\"> \n        I used a 5-stage Design Thinking model proposed by the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford (the \"d. school\"). The stages of this Design Thinking process are as follows:\n        1. Empathise, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, 5. Test.\n        </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"iitem5_1\">\n        <div className=\"description4\"> \n        Design we had previously is below.

However, for users who are lost there is the question mark icon on the right upper angle. When clicking it, it explains what to do. \nThe home page is designed to discover new music and see what are your friends are listenin  </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"iitem8\">\n         <div id=\"stationScreenshot\"></div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"iitem9\">\n        <div className=\"sectionName\"> \n           Station\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"description4\">\n        After getting feedback for the initial app, I realized  that people were confused about navigation. That’s why I decided to move starting the listening party to the user account page. I also decided to add a positive reinforcement of hosting listening parties by adding the number of listeners on the account. \n </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"iitem10\">\n         <div id=\"discoverScreenshot\"></div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"iitem11\">\n        <div className=\"sectionName\"> \n           Discover\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"description4\">\n        Users liked the Discovery page as it was intuitively understandable that the bigger bubbles show playlists that are more aligned with the taste. Adding this visual got a very positive feedback. Therefore, I decided to make it a central button.\n </div>\n        </div>\n\n\n        <div className=\"iitem12\">\n        <div className=\"sectionName\"> \n           User Research\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"miniSectionName\"> \n           Research Strategy\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"description10\"> \n        The first thing we focused on was our research strategy. In order to identify the flaws in the current UX and UI, we conducted a usability test by interviewing people that fit our user archetype. These were users who are the university student age who listen to music often, loves doing it, and have long-distance friendships. Before we began our interviews we first needed to do two things.\nFirst we conduct a competitor analysis. Aside from using and understanding Musaik, this also gave us an insight in the market space and provided additional context for the problem we are working on. Secondly we create an interview guide in preparation for Usability Testing. This enabled us to conduct our interviews in a consistent and controlled manner.\n        </div>\n        </div>\n\n        {/* <div className=\"iitem13\"> \n          <div className=\"miniSectionName\">\n            Competitor Analysis \n            </div>\n            <div className=\"description11\"> \n          As part of our Competitor Analysis, we conducted an analysis on three apps with similar product offerings to Memento.

As the simulation runs, the astronauts undertake a series of virtual \"flights\" and are scored based on their performance. The highest-performing astronauts are selected to \"breed\" and pass on their genes to the next generation. This process continues, with each new generation of astronauts building on the successful traits of the previous generation, and discarding less successful ones. Over time, the population of astronauts evolves to become more efficient and skilled at flying back to Earth.\nUsers are able to observe the simulation as it progresses, watching as the population of astronauts improves and the optimal flight technique emerges. The simulation also provides visual representation of the genetic algorithm, such as graphs of the average fitness of the population over time, and highlighting the genes of the fittest individuals. The simulation provides an interactive way of understanding how genetic algorithm works in machine learning and how it can be applied in real world scenarios.\n        </div>\n        </div> \n\n        <div class=\"p3\"  >\n        <div className=\"editor5\">\n        <iframe src=\"https://editor.p5js.org/alima21/full/Y227mV9CC\">\n          </iframe> \n        </div>\n      </div> \n\n        </div> \n        </div> \n    </div>\n  </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Project5Description;","/Users/alimazhagufarova/personal/personal/front-end/src/pages/projects/project4.js",["145"],[],"import React from \"react\";\nimport Header from \"../../components/header\";\nimport \"./project4.css\";\nimport Vimeo from '@u-wave/react-vimeo';\n\nfunction Project4Description() {\n  return ( \n  <div className=\"home\">\n  <div>\n      <Header />\n  </div>\n  <div className = \"bodyPart\">\n    <div className=\"title4\"> \n    You Are the Problem\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"project4\"> \n        <div class=\"grid-container4 \">\n        <div class=\"ppart2\">\n        <div className=\"projectDesc\" > \n        The <div className=\"bold\"> simulation</div>, created in <div className=\"bold\"> Unity VR</div>, aimed to educate users on the impacts of <div className=\"bold\"> fast fashion</div> through interactive scenes.

Scene two transported users to a virtual store where they were able to see the consequences of their purchasing choices, such as the depletion of resources and pollution caused by the disposal of cheap clothing. Users were able to move objects in the scene.
