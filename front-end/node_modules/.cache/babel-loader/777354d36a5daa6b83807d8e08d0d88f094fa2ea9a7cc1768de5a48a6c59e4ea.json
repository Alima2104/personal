If you want to find new artists, you'll have to sift through playlist on top of playlist for hours. You can listen to music together with your friends on Spotify, but it only limited to 8 people, and only people who sent you an invitation. Musaik will connect users through streaming parties and auto-match chats. Users will discover new music easily and enjoyably.\n          </div> \n          </div>  \n\n          <div class=\"iitem4\">\n           <div className=\"sectionName\"> \n           Project Scope\n           </div>\n          <div className=\"description3\"> \n            Originally as a project for the Agile Software Development class, we as a team were supposed to quickly create an app from scratch in the agile style, and we only had 2 days to come up with the UX/UI prototype. <br/>\n            Now, after this class has ended, I challenged myself in creating a more user-friendly and intuitive design for Musaik so it can help more people to discover new music and connect through it.  <br/>\n            Based on the existing MVP I created a high-fidelity prototype with many iterations including user testing. This project was highly focused on UI design and exploring multiple solutions for launching this app\n          </div>\n          </div>\n\n        <div class=\"iitem5\">\n        <div className=\"sectionName\"> \n           Design Process\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"description4\"> \n        I used a 5-stage Design Thinking model proposed by the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford (the \"d. school\"). The stages of this Design Thinking process are as follows:\n        1. Empathise, 2. Define, 3. Ideate, 4. Prototype, 5. Test.\n        </div>\n        </div>\n        \n        <div class=\"iitem6\">\n         <div id=\"homeScreenshot\"></div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"iitem7\">\n        <div className=\"sectionName\"> \n           Home\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"description4\"> We introduced the homepage in order to provide a central place for a user to go from when starting their Memento journey.\nUsers have the option to Record a Session or access their Saved Recordings.\nThere is also a short video that explains how the whole process works, again to reinforce the information we are trying to convey but this time in form of video.\nWe also Introduced our Help Bot. This button pops up and explains the elements of the apps. This is only shown once and only comes up when using the app for the first time. </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"iitem8\">\n         <div id=\"stationScreenshot\"></div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"iitem9\">\n        <div className=\"sectionName\"> \n           Station\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"description4\">\n          We decided to introduce fun and friendly illustrations that would support the questions. We chose illustrations over pictures because they’re timeless and reflect emotional sentimentality of memories that are often not as deliberate and certain as a photograph. </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"iitem10\">\n         <div id=\"discoverScreenshot\"></div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"iitem11\">\n        <div className=\"sectionName\"> \n           Discover\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"description4\">\n        The recording process wasn't clear – both before, during and after the recording. Users were not aware that the app was recording all the time and assumed that they had to click a button to start a recording.\nWe decided on the iconography of the microphone  to give the users the ability to start/pause/save their recordings. A power that wasn’t given to them in the previous prototype.\nBy doing this we have removed the uncertainty of knowing when the recording would begin and end.\n </div>\n        </div>\n\n\n        <div className=\"iitem12\">\n        <div className=\"sectionName\"> \n           User Research\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"miniSectionName\"> \n           Research Strategy\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"description10\"> \n        The first thing we focused on was our research strategy. In order to identify the flaws in the current UX and UI, we conducted a usability test by interviewing people that fit our user archetype. These were users over the age of 50 who had lost a loved one within the past 5-10 years. Before we began our interviews we first needed to do two things.\nFirst we conduct a competitor analysis. Aside from using and understanding Memento, this also gave us an insight in the market space and provided additional context for the problem we are working on. Secondly we create an interview guide in preparation for Usability Testing. This enabled us to conduct our interviews in a consistent and controlled manner.\n        </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"iitem13\"> \n          <div className=\"miniSectionName\">\n            Competitor Analysis \n            </div>\n            <div className=\"description11\"> \n          As part of our Competitor Analysis, we conducted an analysis on three apps with similar product offerings to Memento.
