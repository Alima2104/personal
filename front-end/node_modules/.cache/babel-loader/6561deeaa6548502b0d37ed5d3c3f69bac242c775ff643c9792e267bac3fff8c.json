In order to identify the flaws in the current UX and UI, we conducted a usability test by interviewing people that fit our user archetype. These were users over the age of 50 who had lost a loved one within the past 5-10 years. Before we began our interviews we first needed to do two things.\nFirst we conduct a competitor analysis. Aside from using and understanding Memento, this also gave us an insight in the market space and provided additional context for the problem we are working on. Secondly we create an interview guide in preparation for Usability Testing. This enabled us to conduct our interviews in a consistent and controlled manner.\n        </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"iiitem18_5\">\n        <div id=\"usabilityResults\"></div>\n        </div>\n\n\n        <div class=\"iiitem19\">\n        <div className=\"sectionName\"> \n           Refined Prototype\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"description10\"> \n        After we decided on the 5 items that we are putting inside the kit,  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
